Target marketing: 
In this problem we are trying to identify groups of people to whom we
can advertise to or give recommendation of the products, so that the
sales can increase while minimizing the cost of advertisement. By
carefully analyzing purchase data we will find a group of customers to
whom we can recommend various items.
